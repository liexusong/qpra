### What is Khepra?
Please see [this link](https://github.com/tykel/khepra-vm).

Below is an early screenshot with several different things going on:
- The sprite has horizontal and vertical doubling enabled.
- A background tilemap is being used.
- The emulator is performing a 3x scale.
- The emulator has a fully functional GUI running in a separate thread from the emulator core.
